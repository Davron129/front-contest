        Welcome to our vocabulary test for kids! Our goal is to provide a fun
        and engaging way for children to learn new words and expand their
        vocabulary. Our team of experienced educators and designers have
        carefully crafted this test to ensure that it is both educational and
        entertaining.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that learning should be a fun and enjoyable experience for
        kids. That's why we have designed our test to be interactive and
        engaging. The test features 10 randomly generated words that float on
        the screen with their translations. Kids can click on a word and then
        select its translation to score points.
      </p>

      <p>
        We offer three levels of difficulty so that kids of all ages and
        abilities can participate. Our leaderboard section on the homepage is
        updated in real-time to show the top scorers in each level. This adds an
        element of competition and encourages kids to keep practicing and
        improving.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of the test, a modal popup appears with the score, start
        again button, and leaderboard button. Kids can see how they did and
        compare their scores with others. We hope that this vocabulary test will
        help children to learn new words, improve their language skills, and
        have fun in the process.
